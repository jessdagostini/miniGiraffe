- Start going over match initial
- Reestruct code to get a lot of reads+seeds pairs
- Try to group seeds that are similar or maybe be closer in the graph
- Create an array fo the GPU with only the offset size we are comparing for each case (probably needs to be 
    something default because can have problems on indexing if it is dybamic)
- Kernel will be the comparison operation
- Can compare if this approach runs faster than the current approach (paralle for each sequence)
- I can have a pointer for that data on the GPU that I dont need to bring back to perform the next step
- Can have a "swap" variable to swap after each node processed (see merge-sort example)
